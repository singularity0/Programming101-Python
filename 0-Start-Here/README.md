Course Starting Pack
========================

In order to be prepared for the course & start solving problems from day 1, you should:

 * [Try Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) - Learn basic syntax of Python. Try to go at least 80% before the first exercise.
 * Install Linux. For example [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation). We'll help you.
 * Install a text editor to start. For example [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

Installing Linux
----------------

Before moving on and installing any Linux, **PLEASE BACKUP EVERYTHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU**.

Don't leave memories only on the hard drive of your PC / laptop. It will eventually fail and you will eventually lose everything that is not backed up.

Our suggestion is, use one or more of the following:
 * [pcloud](https://www.pcloud.com/)
 * [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
